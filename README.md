# 🛡️ Enterprise Network Sniffer IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

**Developed by:** © 2026 **Syed Shaheer Hussain**

## 📌 Project Introduction

The **Enterprise Network Sniffer IDS** is a Python‑based enterprise‑grade **network traffic monitoring and intrusion detection system**. It captures live network packets, analyzes them in real time, detects suspicious or malicious behavior (such as port scanning, flooding, abnormal traffic patterns), and generates **forensic‑ready PDF reports**.

>[!caution]
> This project is designed for **learning, research, academic (FYP), and defensive security simulation purposes**.

## 🎯 Mission & Vision

### 🎯 Mission

To provide a **practical, understandable, and extensible IDS solution** that helps students and security enthusiasts understand how real‑world network monitoring and intrusion detection systems work.

### 🌍 Vision

To evolve this system into a **full enterprise SOC‑ready IDS/IPS platform** with dashboards, ML‑based detection, and SIEM integration.

## ❓ What is a Network?

A **network** is a collection of devices (computers, servers, routers, switches, IoT devices) connected together to share data and resources.

Examples:

* 🌐 Internet
* 🏢 Office LAN
* ☁️ Cloud infrastructure

## 🔍 What is Network Sniffing?

**Network sniffing** is the process of:

* Capturing network packets
* Inspecting headers & payloads
* Analyzing traffic behavior

### Why Sniffing is Important?

* Detect attacks
* Troubleshoot networks
* Monitor bandwidth
* Forensic investigation

>[!important]
> ⚠️ Sniffing without permission is **illegal**.

## 🛡️ What is an IDS?

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** monitors network traffic and:

* Detects malicious patterns
* Generates alerts
* Logs incidents
* Produces reports

### IDS Types

1. **NIDS** – Network‑based IDS ✅ (This project)
2. HIDS – Host‑based IDS


## 💡 Why This Project Was Made?

✔️ To learn **real‑world cybersecurity**
✔️ To simulate **enterprise IDS behavior**
✔️ To understand **packet‑level attacks**
✔️ To build a **portfolio‑grade security project**
✔️ To prepare for SOC / Blue Team roles
